# AI Handoff

This is the single source of truth for picking this project up cold. Read it
first, then check the code and `git log`; if this file disagrees with the code,
trust the code and fix this file.

## 1. Project Goal

A Windows-first desktop app for minimal floating sticky notes, plus a separate
note that shows which local AI harness tasks are currently running. Everything
is local: no account, no sync, no server.

## 2. Product Decisions

- Windows first; macOS/Linux later, so avoid Windows-only architecture.
- Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite.
- Users get multiple independent floating notes.
- Normal notes and the Harness Task Note are separate concepts.
- All data stays local.
- There is no large main window; notes are small floating windows.
- A system tray is the permanent entry point.
- No launch-at-startup by default.
- The Harness Task Note shows only currently running tasks.
- Harness integration will eventually support both push (harness reports in)
  and pull (app reads harness state).
- One note = one JSON file, one window, one stable id. No SQLite.
- Closing a note window means deleting that note, with no confirmation.
- Tray Exit must never delete notes.

## 3. Architecture

- **React/TypeScript** owns UI, per-view state and user interaction only.
- **Rust/Tauri** owns note identity, persistence, window lifecycle, the tray,
  OS capabilities, local paths and (later) harness communication. React asks
  Rust via commands and never touches note files or desktop lifecycle itself.
- **Windows**: each window mounts its own React root. `App.tsx` reads that
  window's own label and renders `NoteWindow` for `note-<id>` labels, so
  there is no shared root window and closing any note cannot affect the others.
- **One entry point per action**: `notes::create_and_open` creates a note for
  startup, the in-note `+` button and the tray New Note item alike. Do not add
  a second window-creation path when the Harness note arrives.
- **Note identity**: `notes.rs` generates `{unix-millis:x}-{sequence:x}` ids.
  The id is the JSON file stem and is embedded in the window label
  (`note-<id>`), so the file name is the authoritative id.
- **Persistence**: `paths.rs` is the only module that resolves the data
  directory; `notes.rs` is the only module that reads or writes note files.
- **Exit model**: two independent ideas. `lib.rs` vetoes `ExitRequested` when
  `code` is `None`, so deleting every note leaves the tray alive. The tray
  Exit item calls `notes::begin_exit` and then `app.exit(0)`. While the
  `exiting` flag is set, `CloseRequested` returns early instead of deleting,
  so shutdown can never be mistaken for a user delete.
- **Visibility is not lifetime**: `notes::hide_all_notes` only calls
  `window.hide()` and `notes::show_all_notes` only calls `window.show()` plus
  `set_focus()`. Neither creates a window, touches a file, or changes
  geometry, content or Pin, so hidden is a session-only state that vanishes on
  restart. Hiding is never undone implicitly: a note created while others are
  hidden appears on its own and leaves the rest hidden.

### Persistence format

One note is one file: `<AppData>/notes/<note-id>.json`. The file name is
the note id and the window label is `note-<id>`, so id, file and window
always agree. A file whose inner `id` disagrees is corrected to its file name
on load rather than forking into a second file.

```json
{
  "id": "1a0d3f574bb-0",
  "content": "",
  "created_at": 1790262293502,
  "updated_at": 1790262293502,
  "window": {
    "x": 60, "y": 60, "width": 330, "height": 300,
    "always_on_top": false
  }
}
```

- Written temp-file-then-rename; if the rename is refused it falls back to
  copying over the target (see Known Issues).
- Every field except `id` is optional on load, so a partial or
  hand-written file still opens. Geometry is physical pixels; size is the
  inner size, position is the outer position.
- `content` is Markdown source. The editor turns it into a rich document
  only in memory; Rust stores the string and does not interpret it. Phase 1
  plain text is valid Markdown, so old notes open as paragraphs.
- A note window needs `core:window:allow-destroy` in its capability. The
  frontend `onCloseRequested` listener closes the window for real by calling
  `destroy()` once its handler returns, so without that permission the X
  button deleted the note's JSON while the window itself stayed open, leaving
  a window whose file was already gone. Deletion is driven by Rust's
  `CloseRequested` handler; the permission only lets the window finish closing.
- A file that cannot be parsed is logged and skipped; the other notes still
  load. A saved position with no real overlap with any current monitor is
  replaced by a cascaded position on the primary monitor.

### Window lifecycle

- `notes::create_and_open` is the only way a note window comes into
  being: startup restore, the in-note `+` button and tray New Note all call it.
- Windows are built hidden, positioned, then shown, so they never flash at
  the default position.
- `CloseRequested` deletes the note unless the process is exiting.
- `Moved`/`Resized` schedule a debounced geometry write (400 ms, latest
  event wins).
- Window-creating commands are `async` on purpose: window creation happens
  on the event loop delivering the invoke, so a synchronous command
  deadlocks.
- The minimum inner size is 220x160; `MIN_WIDTH`/`MIN_HEIGHT` in `notes.rs` are
  the only place it is set. Below that the toolbar and the note body stop
  fitting together.

## 4. Current Phase

Phase 3 — Desktop Experience

Status: Completed

Done:

- Phase 1 sticky notes, still one JSON file and one window per note.
- Phase 2 Markdown editing with todos, links and a WYSIWYG window.
- The tray menu is the whole desktop surface:
  `New Note / Show All Notes / Hide All Notes / Start with Windows / Exit`,
  separated into their groups.
- **Hide All Notes / Show All Notes** hide and reveal existing note windows.
  Hiding is session-only: no window is created or destroyed, no file is read or
  written, and content, geometry and Pin are untouched. New Note while notes
  are hidden leaves the hidden ones hidden.
- **Start with Windows** is a checkable tray item backed entirely by the
  official `tauri-plugin-autostart`. The tick is read from the real OS state on
  startup, and a failed change is written back from the OS value rather than
  trusting the click. There is no registry edit, no startup-folder shortcut and
  no self-managed autostart flag of our own.
- **Tray Exit flushes hidden notes too.** The flush handshake runs for every
  open window, hidden or not, so text typed moments before Hide All survives.
- The minimum window size is 220x160 (was 240x160). At that size the toolbar is
  29 px tall, leaving 131 px of the 160 for the note, and typing, `+`, Pin, todo
  checkboxes, vertical scrolling and horizontal code scrolling all work.
- Light UI polish only: a more compact toolbar, lighter borders, natural hover
  and active states, a filled (not tinted) Pin state, a trimmed placeholder and
  "Not saved" shown only when a save actually failed.

Not done (intentionally, do not start without a new task):

- Images, search, themes, settings window, global shortcuts, custom colors or
  opacity, frameless windows, a Markdown toolbar, SQLite, harness protocol,
  harness adapters.

## 6. Current Behavior

- `npm run tauri dev` launches straight into the user notes: every saved note
  reopens with its content, position, size and always-on-top, or one blank note
  appears when nothing was saved.
- `+` in a note, and New Note in the tray, both create another note and never
  collide with existing ids.
- Typing saves itself shortly after the last keystroke; there is no Save button
  and no "saved" toast. The stored text is Markdown, including todo checkboxes.
- Ctrl+click opens a link in the default browser or mail app. A plain click
  edits it. Anything other than http, https or mailto is ignored.
- Tray Exit waits up to 1.5s for every open note to finish its last save, then
  quits. It still never deletes notes.
- Moving or resizing a note is written back to disk after a short quiet period,
  so restarting restores the layout.
- Pin toggles always-on-top for that note only, and survives a restart.
- Closing a note window deletes that note and leaves the others untouched.
- Deleting every note leaves the process and tray running; New Note brings the
  app back.
- Hide All Notes hides every note window and keeps them: nothing is deleted and
  nothing is written, so Show All Notes returns the same notes on the same
  screen. A restart shows them again, because hidden is not persisted.
- New Note while notes are hidden opens the new note and leaves the others
  hidden.
- Start with Windows in the tray ticks and unticks the real Windows Run entry
  through the official autostart plugin, and starts ticked if the entry is
  already there.
- A note can be resized down to 220x160; the toolbar stays usable and the note
  body keeps most of the height.
- Tray Exit quits the process and keeps every note file, including notes that
  were hidden.
- A corrupt or hand-edited note file is logged and skipped without stopping the
  other notes from loading.

## 7. Verification

Run on Windows (Node 24.11.0, Rust 1.91.1, MSVC at F:\software\VisualStudio):

```
npm test                  PASS  67 tests (markdown, todos, link rules)
npm run typecheck         PASS
npm run build             PASS  (only the pre-existing chunk-size warning)
cargo check --all-targets PASS  (no warnings)
cargo build               PASS
cargo build --release     PASS
```

Re-run for Phase 3, after the tray, autostart, minimum size and CSS changes:

```
npm test                  PASS  67 tests (3 files)
npm run typecheck         PASS
npm run build             PASS  (same pre-existing chunk-size warning)
cargo check --all-targets PASS  (no warnings)
cargo build               PASS
```

Behaviour confirmed against a running build, driven through the WebView2 CDP
endpoint and real Win32 window messages. The Markdown editor checklist below
was re-run after the textarea was replaced, and the Phase 2 items were added:

```
Phase 2 (Markdown / Todo)
Todo cold start        PASS  `- [ ] Task`, `- [x] Task` become real task items
Todo persistence       PASS  clicking a checkbox round-trips through Markdown
Underscore round-trip  PASS  FINAL_TOKEN_123456 is stored unescaped
Quick Exit x3          PASS  typed text survived all three Tray Exit runs
  round 1              input->exit <300 ms; process gone in 378 ms
  round 2              input->exit <300 ms; process gone in 357 ms
  round 3              input->exit <300 ms; process gone in 384 ms
  each run             disk + UI = FINAL_TOKEN_123456
In-flight save + exit  PASS  OLD_STATE_ then FINAL_STATE_123456 within the
                             debounce window saved in full; process gone in
                             383 ms; disk + UI = OLD_STATE_FINAL_STATE_123456
Close = Delete race A  PASS  X inside the 300 ms debounce: window gone, JSON
                             gone, still absent after 3 s, not restored
Close = Delete race B  PASS  content + move + resize + Pin all pending at the
                             moment of X: JSON never reappeared, not restored
os error 32            PASS  10/10 serial create -> immediate get_note reads
                             succeeded; the single earlier occurrence did not
                             reproduce (see Known Issues)
Phase 1 regression     PASS  see the Phase 1 checklist below
```

Phase 1 checklist, re-run on the current Markdown editor:

```
1 New notes        PASS  created from the in-note `+` button and from tray
                         New Note; ids and labels unique
2 Content restore  PASS  every note's Markdown returned after a restart
3 Window restore   PASS  moved/resized notes returned at the same position and
                         size (physical px)
4 Pin persist      PASS  only the pinned note came back pinned
5 Delete           PASS  window gone, its JSON gone, others untouched
6 Close all notes  PASS  all JSON removed; process + tray still alive;
                         tray New Note recreated a note
7 Tray Exit        PASS  process exited; every note JSON survived and all
                         notes restored on the next start
8 Corrupt JSON     PASS  bad file logged + skipped; the other notes loaded
Off-screen recovery PASS  a note saved at (9000,9000) was pulled back on screen
```

Phase 3 (Desktop Experience), every scenario run against a live build:

```
Tray menu            PASS  8 items: New Note, Show All Notes, Hide All Notes,
                           Start with Windows, Exit and three separators
A  3 notes -> Hide All PASS 3 windows hidden, 0 visible, process alive,
                           3 JSON files untouched
B  Hide All -> Show All PASS 3 windows visible again; content, geometry
                           (60,60 / 92,92 / 124,124 at 330x300) and Pin
                           unchanged byte for byte
C  Hide All -> New Note PASS new note visible itself, the other notes stayed
                           hidden; Show All was not triggered
D  Autostart OFF -> ON PASS real HKCU Run value =
                           F:\study\note_app\src-tauri\target\debug\

                           `autostart requested=true actual=true`
   Autostart ON -> OFF PASS key gone again; log
                           `autostart requested=false actual=false`;
                           left OFF afterwards, as required
E  fast typing -> Hide PASS typed SCENARIO_E_TOKEN_9876, Hide All, Tray Exit
   -> Exit -> restart       328 ms later; disk + UI = SCENARIO_E_TOKEN_9876
F  X delete -> Show All PASS deleted note gone from disk and stayed gone
                           across Hide All + Show All; 3 notes left, no
                           resurrection
G  delete all -> tray   PASS 0 notes and 0 JSON files, process and tray alive,
   -> New Note             menu intact, New Note created 1a0d887e9b0-0
Hidden exit flush      PASS  FINAL_HIDDEN_TOKEN typed, Hide All, Tray Exit:
                           369 ms; disk + UI = FINAL_HIDDEN_TOKEN
220x160                PASS  forced to the floor: inner size 220x160, typing
                           works, `+` and Pin are clickable, a real todo
                           checkbox click flips it to checked, the editor
                           scrolls vertically, and the toolbar is 29 px tall
                           (131 px of 160 left for the note)
```

## 8. Known Issues

- **Capabilities the frontend needs must be granted explicitly.**
  `core:window:allow-destroy` is what lets a closing note window actually
  finish closing; without it the X button deleted the JSON and left the window
  on screen. `core:window:allow-set-size` is granted for the same reason, so
  the note can be resized to its documented 220x160 floor. `core:window:default`
  contains neither, which is worth remembering before adding the next window
  API call.
- **An `os error 32` read race was observed once during runtime verification,**
  but repeated `create -> immediate get_note` checks could not reproduce it.
  Fifteen serial runs (6 + 10) of create-then-read all succeeded. Persistence
  was deliberately left unchanged rather than restructured around a race that
  no longer reproduces.
- **`fs::rename` can be refused on this machine.** Inside the AppData tree the
  rename returns `ERROR_NOT_SAME_DEVICE` (`os error 17`) even though both files
  are in the same directory, so `write_record` falls back to copying over the
  destination and logs a warning. This is the same environment quirk that
  breaks the NSIS bundler. Saves are correct either way; the atomic rename path
  is simply unavailable here and will be used normally elsewhere.
- **`npm run tauri build` cannot finish the NSIS bundle** with
  `failed to bundle project: 系统无法将文件移到不同的磁盘驱动器。 (os error 17)`
  while extracting its own toolchain. Verified environmental, not a project
  defect: a pristine `create-tauri-app` scaffold fails identically on this
  machine. `--bundles msi` succeeds.
- **This machine MSVC is not registered with `vswhere`**, so plain
  `cargo build` fails with a missing `link.exe`. Call
  `F:\software\VisualStudio\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat` first. Environment
  quirk, not a project defect.
- **The window-geometry debounce is last-write-wins.** Two rapid moves can let a
  slightly older read-modify-write win, which is invisible in practice because
  the next move rewrites it. Revisit only if geometry drift is ever reported.
- Automated UI verification used temporary CDP / UI-Automation helper scripts
  that live in %TEMP%\sh-verify and are not part of the repo; re-create them
  if runtime behaviour must be re-tested.

## 9. Next Step

Next: Phase 4 — Harness Protocol

Direction only, do not start without a new task. The roadmap name is the whole
spec so far: do not invent themes, settings, search or shortcuts, and do not
implement the harness here. Phase 4 is about agreeing how a local AI harness
reports what it is running to this app - the message shape and the boundary
between push (a harness reports in) and pull (the app reads harness state).

Constraints that already hold and must survive Phase 4:

- `notes.rs` stays the only owner of note persistence, and `create_and_open`
  stays the only way a note window comes into being.
- The Harness Task Note is a separate concept from a normal sticky note. It is
  not a note file, and it must not go through the note JSON format.
- Everything stays local: no account, no sync, no server.
